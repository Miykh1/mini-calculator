A small interactive web calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations and includes a feature suggestion box to demonstrate DOM manipulation skills.

## Features

  - Subtraction  
  - Multiplication  
  - Division (with division-by-zero check)  
  - Mean  
  - Modulus (requires exactly 2 numbers)
